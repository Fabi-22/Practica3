# Description:
This project involves the development of an object-oriented program, implemented in Java with JDK 22 using Visual Studio, that validates chess games written in Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN). The validation process follows official chess rules, ensuring the correctness of each move and the logical sequence of the game.

If the game is valid, the program visually represents its progress using a binary tree that reflects the turns of both players, facilitating understanding of the game’s progression and possible branching moves. For the graphical interface, PyQt or Qt-based technologies are employed, integrated into the project to provide a dynamic and user-friendly visualization.
